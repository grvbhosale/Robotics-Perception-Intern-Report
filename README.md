# Robotics-Perception-Intern-Report
This is my report for my internship at Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) .  
Since this is governemnt organization and I had to access to the code only at their terminal . I had to sign NDA to join thus ,the report below does not contain code but includes the process followed and the outcomes of my work.<br />
<br />
Role - Robotics Perception Intern
<br /><br />
Implementing Velodyne Lidar -16 and Monocular Camera sensor fusion using extrinsic calibration .<br />
• Displaying fused Lidar points on camera image using OpenCV’s geometric projection on pinhole camera model.<br />
• Implemented YOLO object detection to draw bounding box in image and project the bounding box detected in Image and transform coordinates of image in Lidar . 2D boxing in 3D world.<br />
• Using Turtlebot for SLAM and Navigation Algorithms<br />
• Worked on Data acquisition of Camera,Lidar,GPS from ARAI’s Autonomous Vehicle ’Swayam Go’.<br />
• Implemented Obstacle detection on Point Cloud Data collected by the vehicle to detect obstacles in the path.This will include RANSAC segmentation of road,plane and obstacles and clustering algorithm in PCL.<br />
• Developed Custom Object Detector using YOLO framework for detecting vehicles specific like Traffic Signs,Rickshaws,bikes and Tempos.<br />
Tools Used- ROS,PCL,OpenCV,Numpy,C++<br />
